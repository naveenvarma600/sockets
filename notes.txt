ROOMS:  groups of sockets ( joining clients )
    ex: groups in whatsapp
io.to('room_name').emit(...)  //for that room only

1) add login system for jquery ( include jquery cdn in index.html)
io.emit //everyone
socket.emit //only itself
socket.broadcast.emit //everyone except itself
io.to('username') //for that user only , but use socket.join(username) //so we associate that socket with that isername
